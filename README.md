# Diabetes Health Indicators Data Analysis

This project demonstrates data analysis and visualization using the Diabetes Health Indicators dataset. The analysis is performed in a Jupyter notebook ([week7-1.ipynb](week7-1.ipynb)), utilizing Python libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and kagglehub.

## Features

- **Data Loading:** Downloads and loads the dataset using kagglehub and pandas.
- **Data Exploration:** Inspects the first few rows, data types, and missing values.
- **Data Cleaning:** Handles missing values by filling or dropping as appropriate.
- **Basic Analysis:** Computes statistics (mean, median, std) and groups data by diabetes status.
- **Visualization:** Includes line charts, bar charts, histograms, and scatter plots with customized labels and legends.
- **Error Handling:** Demonstrates robust exception handling for file reading and data analysis.

## Usage

1. Open [week7-1.ipynb](week7-1.ipynb) in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run the cells sequentially to perform data analysis and view visualizations.
